# Lockscreen Gif
A simple application to set your windows lockscreen to a video or a GIF image.
You cannot set a GIF as a lockscreen using the normal windows settings even when using file extension spoofing but with some Windows system image cache modifications you can trick Windows into using a GIF on your lockscreen.

# Notes
ONLY real .GIF files are supported.
Videos cannot work and will never work directly, please use the video option to dynamically create a gif to use.
GIFs created through the video option are created with [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [Gifski](https://gif.ski/) to produce high quality, video like gifs.
