# Lockscreen Gif
A simple application to set your windows lockscreen to a GIF image.
You cannot set a GIF as a lockscreen using the normal windows settings even when using file extension spoofing but with some Windows system image cache modifications you can trick Windows into using a GIF on your lockscreen.

# Notes
ONLY real .GIF files are supported.
Videos cannot work and will never work, if you want to use a video then use FFMPEG to convert the video to a GIF. Due to limitations in the GIF format I found animations to work best with the limited colour palette, then using a custom made palette with FFMPEG.
